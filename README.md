The incomplete source for my personal website/portfolio for demonstration and educational purposes.

This website is styled using the Sass CSS extension language, and the compiled/map files aren't being uploaded to this repository. If, for whatever reason, you wish to clone the repository and view it locally, you will need to compile the `.scss` files first using your method of choice.
